# OceanCare Initiative Website

This project is a website for the "OceanCare Initiative," a non-profit organization dedicated to ocean protection. The goal is to raise awareness, share the organization's work, and collect donations. This project is being developed for the Human-Computer Interaction course (INFOA3v).

## Project Explanation for Teacher Approval

This project aims to apply key principles of Human-Computer Interaction to create an effective and user-friendly website for a non-profit organization. The design focuses on:

*   **Clear Navigation and Information Architecture:** The website is structured with a clear hierarchy, allowing users to easily find information about the organization's projects, team, and ways to contribute.
*   **User Engagement:** The site encourages user interaction through clear calls-to-action, a volunteer sign-up form, and a planned interactive donation calculator.
*   **Accessibility:** The design will consider accessibility standards to ensure the website is usable by people with diverse abilities.
*   **User-Centered Design:** The development process started by analyzing the client's requirements and will proceed with the user's experience as a central focus.

## Features

*   **Homepage (`index.html`):** Displays the organization's mission and provides a gateway to other sections of the site.
*   **Subpages:**
    *   `projects.html`: Showcases the various projects and initiatives.
