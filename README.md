# OceanCare Initiative Website

Look, we made a website for ocean conservation. It's pretty straightforward. You come here, you learn about what we're doing to help the oceans, maybe you volunteer, maybe you donate. That's it. That's the whole thing.

## What's on Here

- **Home page** — explains what we do, shows some news about ocean stuff
- **Projects** — the actual work we're doing
- **Team** — the people who work here
- **How to Help** — ways you can contribute, if you want to
- **Volunteer signup** — if you want to volunteer, you fill this out

## How to Run It

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Stack

HTML, Tailwind CSS on the frontend. Node.js and Express in the back. Nothing fancy. It works.
