## 🔥 THE CRITICAL PATH (DO NOT SKIP)

```
TODAY (Nov 23):
├─ ⏱️  60-75 minutes
├─ 🔴 CRITICAL: Must complete today or everything pushes back
├─ Task: Register 3 APIs (Storm Glass, OpenUV, Visual Crossing)
├─ Deliverable: .env updated, npm test shows 21/21 ✅
└─ Result: Unlock entire test suite

THEN (Nov 24-29):
├─ Mobile testing, code polish, accessibility audit
└─ Result: Production-ready Week 1 sign-off

THEN (Nov 30 - Dec 5):
├─ Security audit, functional testing, stress testing
└─ Result: Zero-critical security sign-off, 100% functional

THEN (Dec 6-16):
├─ Deploy to Vercel, train team, launch
└─ Result: LIVE on production ✅
```

**If you skip or delay the API registration (Day 1), everything else gets pushed back.**
