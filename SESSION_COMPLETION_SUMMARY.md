## 💡 Important Notes

### Configuration Before Launch
The following must be configured before going live:

- [ ] Stripe live API keys (not test keys)
- [ ] SendGrid production account with verified domain
- [ ] PostgreSQL database (not SQLite)
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificate
- [ ] Domain name and DNS
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Performance monitoring (New Relic/Datadog)
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation

### Security Reminders
1. Never commit secrets to git - use .env files
2. Rotate JWT secrets every 90 days in production
3. Use HTTPS only in production
4. Keep dependencies updated - run `npm audit` monthly
5. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Cloudflare
6. Regular database backups and restore testing

### Team Responsibilities
- **Frontend Dev:** Mobile optimization, form improvements
- **Backend Dev:** API integration completion, testing
- **DevOps:** Deployment automation, monitoring setup
- **Product Manager:** Feature prioritization, user testing
- **Support Team:** Documentation review, user support
