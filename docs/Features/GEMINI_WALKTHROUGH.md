# OceanCare Gemini Paper Prototype Walkthrough

**Last updated:** 2025-11-23

## Purpose
The Gemini walkthrough documents the Human Computer Interaction course prototype scenarios for the OceanCare mobile concept. It exposes the three required user journeys (volunteer signup, debris reporting, donation) with facilitator prompts and printable sketch assets.

## Assets
- Page: `pages/gemini-walkthrough.html`
- Illustrations directory: `assets/prototype/`
  - `task1_step1_home.svg`
  - `task1_step2_confirm.svg`
  - `task2_step1_report.svg`
  - `task2_step2_submit.svg`
  - `task3_step1_donate.svg`
  - `task3_step2_thanks.svg`

## Usage Notes
1. Print the SVG screens on card stock for classroom demonstrations. Overlay pop-up cards when prompts instruct you to place a confirmation state.
2. Use the web page during remote critiques. Each image is captioned with the corresponding persona, task, and facilitator talking points.
3. Update the SVGs when task flows change. Keep annotations minimal to preserve the paper sketch feel.
4. Keep screenshots synced with any revisions to the underlying mobile UX. Revise this document after major design iterations.

## Next Steps
- Capture video walkthroughs of each task for asynchronous reviews.
- Connect the prototype explanations to the research synthesis in `docs/Planning`.
- If the Gemini project expands, consider a lightweight React storybook for interactive wireframes.
