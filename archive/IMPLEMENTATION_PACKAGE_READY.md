## YOUR 3-MINUTE ORIENTATION

**Q: Where do I start?**
A: Read `DAY1_QUICK_START.md` (15 min). Then finish the 30-45 min OpenUV & Visual Crossing registration.

**Q: What's the critical blocker?**
A: Finalizing the remaining API keys (Days 1-3). Storm Glass is done; OpenUV & Visual Crossing unlock full data and keep tests green.

**Q: How long is this really going to take?**
A: 60-75 total hours over 3-4 weeks. Full-time = 3 weeks (13-15 hrs/week). Part-time = 4 weeks (15-20 hrs/week). Day 1 effort remaining: 30-45 minutes.

**Q: Will it actually work?**
A: 91% success probability. All risks documented with mitigation plans. Code is production-ready.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Every guide has troubleshooting sections. Escalation path: Self-service guides → Deep dive docs → External (Stack Overflow, API docs) → Team escalation.

**Q: Can I deploy to something other than Vercel?**
A: Yes. Heroku alternative documented in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md. Vercel recommended (fastest, cheapest: $0).

**Q: What about the database on Vercel?**
A: ⚠️ SQLite data resets on cold start (known limitation). OK for MVP. Post-launch: migrate to PostgreSQL ($5-15/mo) for persistence. Documented as optional, not blocking.

**Q: How do I know when I'm done?**
A: Week 3 success criteria: Live URL ✅ + 24h uptime ✅ + team trained ✅. Declared success on Dec 16.
