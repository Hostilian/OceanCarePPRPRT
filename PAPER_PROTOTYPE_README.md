**Content:**
- Background: Faded donation screen (to show context)
- Pop-up overlay (white box with shadow) showing:
  - "THANK YOU!" message
  - "Your $20 donation has been received!"
  - Impact statement: "Saves 5 sea turtles from plastic"
  - "Done" button to close

**Interaction:**
- User taps "Donate Now" button from Image 5

## How to Use These Images for User Testing

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Print all 6 images on standard 8.5" × 11" paper or cardstock
2. For pop-up images (2 and 6), print on separate sheets and cut them out carefully
3. Prepare a clean surface for laying out the prototype

### Step 2: Testing Task 1 (Event Registration)
1. Start with Image 1 visible to the user
2. Ask user: "How would you find and join a beach cleanup event?"
3. User taps on "Find Events" button area
4. You place Image 2's pop-up on top of Image 1
5. Ask user: "Would you confirm this registration?"
6. Observe: Does the user understand the confirmation dialog?
7. Remove pop-up and show "Success" message verbally or on paper

### Step 3: Testing Task 2 (Debris Reporting)
1. Return to Image 1 (Home Screen)
2. Ask user: "How would you report trash you found on the beach?"
3. User indicates "Report Issue" button
4. You present Image 3 (blank form)
5. Ask user to show you how they would fill in the form
6. Record what information they think is needed
7. Show Image 4 as an example of completed form
8. Ask: "Is this how you would complete it? Any changes?"

### Step 4: Testing Task 3 (Donation)
1. Return to Image 1 (Home Screen)
2. Ask user: "How would you donate to ocean conservation?"
3. User selects "Donate" button
4. You present Image 5 (Donation screen)
5. Ask: "How much would you donate? Why that amount?"
6. Observe: Do the donation amounts seem appropriate?
7. User selects amount, you place Image 6 pop-up on top
8. Ask: "Is this confirmation helpful? What else would you want to see?"

### Step 5: Data Collection
During testing, record:
- ✓ Did user understand the flow easily?
- ✓ Any confusion or hesitation?
- ✓ Suggested improvements to interface
- ✓ Preferred interaction patterns
- ✓ Missing features or information
- ✓ Overall satisfaction with design

## Key Paper Prototype Advantages

1. **Low-Fidelity:** Hand-drawn style encourages feedback on functionality, not aesthetics
2. **Fast Iteration:** Easy to modify based on user feedback
3. **Interactive:** Uses physical pop-ups to simulate real interaction
4. **User-Centered:** Three realistic personas with actual goals
5. **Cost-Effective:** Requires only paper and printing (no coding needed)
6. **Flexible:** Facilitator can explain and adapt during testing
7. **Complete:** Each task has a clear start and end state
