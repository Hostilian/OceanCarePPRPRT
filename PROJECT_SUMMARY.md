# OceanCare Initiative: Project Summary for HCI Course

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a user-centered website prototype for the "OceanCare Initiative," a non-profit dedicated to ocean protection. The website aims to raise awareness, showcase the organization's projects, and encourage donations and volunteer sign-ups.

This project applies key Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to ensure the website is effective, engaging, and accessible.

## 2. Paper Prototype Overview

The paper prototype demonstrates the core user journeys for two key personas: a potential donor and an aspiring volunteer.

### Key User Tasks & Scenarios:

1.  **Making a Donation:**
    *   A user arrives on the homepage.
    *   They explore the projects and decide to donate.
    *   They use an interactive calculator to see the impact of their donation.
    *   After donating, they can view their donation history on a personal dashboard.

2.  **Becoming a Volunteer:**
    *   A user finds the volunteer section.
    *   They fill out a simple form to express their interest.
    *   They receive immediate confirmation that their application is submitted.

### Prototype Screens:

The prototype consists of several screens representing the user flow:

*   **Homepage:** First impression, mission, and news.
*   **Projects:** Showcase of the organization's work.
*   **How to Help:** Donation calculator and volunteer call-to-action.
*   **Volunteer Form:** Simple sign-up for volunteers.
*   **Login & Dashboard:** For donors to track their history.

This prototype is designed to be "run" with a user to test the clarity of the navigation and the effectiveness of the user flow for these key tasks.
