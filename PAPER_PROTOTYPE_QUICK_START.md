---

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Print the Images
```
1. Print all 6 prototype images (PNG files)
2. High quality: Use color printer if available
3. Size: Standard 8.5" × 11" paper or cardstock recommended
```

**Files to Print:**
- `prototype_1_home_screen.png`
- `prototype_2_events_confirmation.png`
- `prototype_3_report_form_blank.png`
- `prototype_4_report_form_filled.png`
- `prototype_5_donate_screen.png`
- `prototype_6_thank_you_popup.png`

### 2. Prepare the Pop-ups
```
1. Print images 2 and 6 on separate sheets
2. Carefully cut out the white pop-up areas
3. Keep the pop-ups separate from base screens
```

### 3. View the Interactive Guide
```
Open: /pages/paper-prototype.html
This shows all images with explanations
```

### 4. Conduct a User Test
```
1. Show Image 1 (Home Screen) to user
2. Ask: "How would you [find events / report debris / donate]?"
3. User points to buttons or indicates actions
4. You place appropriate pop-ups on top
5. Observe and take notes on user behavior
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for User Testing

### Before Testing
- [ ] Print all images clearly
- [ ] Cut out pop-ups neatly
- [ ] Have pen and paper ready for notes
- [ ] Prepare 3-5 test participants
- [ ] Test script (see below)

### During Testing
- [ ] One person facilitates, one takes notes
- [ ] Ask open-ended questions: "How would you...?"
- [ ] Don't explain—let users figure it out
- [ ] Record confusion, hesitation, suggestions
- [ ] Time each task (target: 1-2 minutes per task)

### Questions to Ask
1. "What would you do next?"
2. "Is this clear?"
3. "Would you change anything?"
4. "How would you report this differently?"
5. "Is the impact message meaningful?"

### After Testing
- Compile feedback from all participants
- Look for patterns (e.g., multiple people confused about location entry)
- Prioritize improvements
- Update design based on feedback

## 📊 What to Measure

**Efficiency:**
- Time to complete each task
- Number of actions to complete task
- Need for help or clarification

**Effectiveness:**
- Did user successfully complete the task?
- Did they understand the process?
- Were goals clear?

**Satisfaction:**
- Would user recommend this app?
- Most/least liked features?
- Trust in the interface?

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to cut out all the pop-ups?**  
A: Only images 2 and 6 need to be cut. Images 1, 3, 4, and 5 stay flat.

**Q: Can I modify the images?**  
A: Yes! Write on them, annotate them, or redraw them based on test feedback.

**Q: How many people should I test with?**  
A: 3-5 users is ideal for paper prototypes. More detailed testing comes with digital version.

**Q: What if a user does something unexpected?**  
A: Great! Write it down. This is valuable feedback about your assumptions.

**Q: Can I test remotely?**  
A: Yes, but physical prototype works best in person. For remote, use the HTML walkthrough.

**Q: How long should user testing take?**  
A: 15-20 minutes per person (introduction + 3 tasks + feedback).

**Q: What's next after paper prototype testing?**  
A: Use feedback to refine digital prototype and begin development.
